See this [Example Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl6WqrZHWFc), or this [Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn_PVMBSJNp0Ci0u7XiNgyP1OorIRmBKV&si=dyT1cIsRO04V-3pG) (Principles of Mathematical Analysis).

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Maintain Original Formatting**: Keep the aesthetic and structure of your original LaTeX document.
- **Customizable Slide Breaks**: Define your slide transitions through simple comment insertions into the LaTeX source.
- **Voice and Video Support**: Leverage [Google Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) to enhance slides with auditory commentary and create high-quality video lectures.

## ðŸ›  Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/)
* [Abseil Flags](https://abseil.io/docs/python/guides/flags)
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
